    "## Word Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Word vectors are a fundamental building block in NLP. They are used directly in many downstream tasks (e.g., classification, retrieval, and translation) and serve as inputs to sequence models—from early RNNs to modern Transformer-based LLMs. Because of this, it’s important to build intuition about their strengths and limitations.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note on Terminology:** The terms \"word vectors\" and \"word embeddings\" are often used interchangeably. The term \"embedding\" refers to the fact that we are encoding aspects of a word's meaning in a lower dimensional space. As [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) states, \"*conceptually it involves a mathematical embedding from a space with one dimension per word to a continuous vector space with a much lower dimension*\"."

    "### Co-Occurrence\n",
    "\n",
    "A **co-occurrence matrix** counts how often tokens appear near each other. Suppose a token $w_i$ appears at position $i$ in a document. With a fixed **window size** $n$, the *context* of $w_i$ consists of the $n$ tokens immediately to the left and the $n$ tokens immediately to the right:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w_{i-n},\\dots,w_{i-1},\\; w_{i+1},\\dots,w_{i+n}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We build a word-by-word matrix $M$ where $M_{ij}$ is the number of times word $w_j$ appears in the context window of word $w_i$ (summed over the whole corpus). Many implementations make $M$ **symmetric** by counting co-occurrences in both directions; in that case $M_{ij}=M_{ji}$.\n",

    "### Distance Weighting\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row (or column) of $M$ can be viewed as a **count-based word vector**, but these vectors are typically very high-dimensional. A simple improvement is to use **distance weighting**: words that appear closer together in the window receive higher weights than those farther apart. We use the weight $w(d) = \\frac{1}{d}$, where $d$ is the distance between the center word and context word. This captures the intuition that immediate neighbors are more semantically relevant than distant ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PPMI Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "With large corpora, high-frequency words and common function words (like \"the\", \"and\") may dominate the raw co-occurrence counts, obscuring meaningful semantic relationships. **Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI)** addresses this by measuring whether two words co-occur more often than expected by chance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{PMI}(w_i, w_j) = \\log \\frac{P(w_i, w_j)}{P(w_i) \\cdot P(w_j)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P(w_i, w_j)$ is the joint probability of the two words appearing together, and $P(w_i)$, $P(w_j)$ are their individual probabilities. PPMI takes the positive part: $\\text{PPMI}(w_i, w_j) = \\max(0, \\text{PMI}(w_i, w_j))$. This transformation reduces the influence of frequent but uninformative co-occurrences while preserving meaningful associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A common way to reduce dimensionality is **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** (closely related to PCA). In practice, we often keep only the top $k$ components (e.g., via truncated SVD) to obtain shorter vectors that capture the most important patterns in co-occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "![SVD Decomposition](imgs/svd.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Projection doesn't create meaning—it can reveal structure that's already present in the data. After dimensionality reduction, words that appear in similar contexts (e.g., *doctor* and *hospital*) tend to be closer to each other than unrelated words (e.g., *doctor* and *dog*).\n",
    "\n",
    "If eigenvalues and SVD are new to you, [here](https://davetang.org/file/Singular_Value_Decomposition_Tutorial.pdf) is a beginner-friendly introduction. In practice, you will typically use library implementations (NumPy/SciPy/scikit-learn). On large corpora, computing a full SVD can be expensive, so we use **truncated** methods (like `TruncatedSVD`) to efficiently extract the top $k$ components."

Moreover, the calculation of the co-occurrence matrix and SVD are both linear dimensionality reduction, while GloVe is optimized through a non-linear loss function. The scales and axes of the two plots are not consistent, resulting in significant differences in the positions and distribution of the points."
